# Salted SHA512

## Description

Salted SHA512 hash. Use salt to increase decrypt resistance.

## Installation

```sh
npm install salted-sha512 --save
```

## Initialization

```js
// Import.
const saltedSha512 = require('salted-sha512');
```

## Using

```js
// Get salted SHA512.
const saltedHash = saltedSha512('Some data.', 'SUPER-S@LT!');
// Value of "saltedHash": "f565a8fbe0b1b3d36427a3b7e0f0d3d9397f207061785211a0078108773990a0cf501a7bb46fc206e7765b17dc8cafb4c09db45e76a3be81e76828e471b7d45b".

// Get salted SHA512 async (as promise). Just set "isAsync" param as "true".
const saltedHashAsync = await saltedSha512('Some data.', 'SUPER-S@LT!', true);
// Value of "saltedHashAsync": "f565a8fbe0b1b3d36427a3b7e0f0d3d9397f207061785211a0078108773990a0cf501a7bb46fc206e7765b17dc8cafb4c09db45e76a3be81e76828e471b7d45b".
